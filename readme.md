# BDD Billing

A suggested method of charging for Behaviour Driven Development.

````
while (unreleased features exist) {
    write scenarios for next release
    charge time

    if (quote required for next release) {
        quote for release

        if (quote rejected and no resolution) {
            client takes scenarios to another Agile Team
        }

        if (quote accepted) {
            develop and release features
            charge quote value
        }

    } else {
       develop and release features
       charge time
    }
}
````

### Advantages
* Gives the client a choice of pay-for-release or pay-for-time.
* Always leaves client with useful output at the end of each iteration.
